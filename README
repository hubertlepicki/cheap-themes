CheapThemes
===========

This plugin provides easy view themes support and customizable controller actions for Rails applications.

Installation
============

First, grab a copy of plugin from repository:

    ./script/plugin install git://github.com/hubertlepicki/cheap-themes.git

Usage
=====

Theming views
-------------

To allow theming of views, include following line in your controller:

    class ExampleController
      has_themable_views :find_view_theme
      ....
    end

and define "find_view_theme" method in the same controller or any of parent ones:
    
    class ExampleController
      has_themable_views :find_view_theme
     
      ....
 
      private 
      def find_view_theme
        "green"
      end
    end

Of course, instead of "find_view_theme" you can use your own name.

Now, if you want to customize index.html.erb view file, create file "RAILS_ROOT/themes/green/views/example/index.html.erb". It's content will be used instead of standard "RAILS_ROOT/app/views/example/index.html.erb".

This also works with layouts, so if you want to customize "default.html.erb" layout, just create file "RAILS_ROOT/app/views/layouts/default.html.erb".

Customizing actions
-------------------

If you want to customize ExampleController::index action, create file "RAILS_ROOT"/themes/green/controllers/example/index.rb" with customized code, for example:

render :text => "This is customized action"

And add in your controller:

    class ExampleController
      has_customizable_actions :find_action_theme
     
      ....
 
      private 
      def find_action_theme
        "green"
      end
    end

General notes
-------------

Of course you can have multiple multiple themes.

In development mode, customized controller actions are reloaded on every request. In production mode, customized controller actions are loaded only once (at first request) and then cached methods are used.
